<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">I was facing an issue that /etc/fstab changes i made were disappearing after i reboot. I found out that i was just hitting the reset button on my target and changes were getting lost due to improper way of rebooting. Proper way 'reboot' command helps avoiding any corruption in SD/MMC filesystem and changes appear fine.</div>
