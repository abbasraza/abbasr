<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">This cost me lot of time. I copied a query from OneNote and pasted it into my python script....and it made me crazy. The copied text contained 'no-break-space' instead of simple 'space' character so the string comparisons failed. rgrrrgrg<br /><br />Had to remove spaces (which we not actually normal space characters) and put them back.<br /><br /><br /><b><br /></b><b>Copying from OneNote includes non-standard characters</b><br /><br />&nbsp;This thread is locked from future replies<br />In 2010, and I wouldn't be surprised if still issue in current version, OneNote corrupts source code pasted/copied.&nbsp; For example, I was using OneNote to keep snippets of cshtml code, but when copying that code from OneNote, some characters are not preserved in their original pasted form.&nbsp; Quotes become smart(dumb) quotes.&nbsp; Space become a non-printable character that appears to be a space, but is not, and as such it breaks the code.&nbsp; The space becomes a no-break-space U+00A0.&nbsp; This breaks any HTML or CSHTML that is pasted, because the spaces inside element tags between attributes, or within attributes, will be encoded and no longer treated as whitespace.&nbsp; This attributes do not work.&nbsp; This is all because OneNote doesn't preserve the space character properly.</div>
