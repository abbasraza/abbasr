For example the high level in TTL standard is 5V. This  signal mostly has a 50% duty cycle, meaning that the duration of a high  and a zero is the same. The frequency of the clock can be anything as  needed by the digital circuit that is using it. But what is a clock used  for?       </div><div align="left" style="margin-bottom: 12; margin-top: 12;">Digital  circuits always have some input and generate digital outputs  accordingly. Some digital circuits are not clocked, meaning that the  input applied to the circuit flows through digital <a href="http://www.designcabana.com/knowledge/electrical/electronics/digital/gates">gates </a>without any timing or storage and generates the output. It only takes a time equal to the <a href="http://www.designcabana.com/knowledge/electrical/electronics/digital/propag">propagation delay time</a> to reach the output.       </div><div align="left" style="margin-bottom: 12; margin-top: 12;">On  the other hand most of the digital circuits that do more complex  processing on the digital inputs such as controllers, processors or  state machines are timed and the signal can't just go through. In these  circuits a clock with a fixed frequency is used for timing. A clock  plays very important role as it is used to open and close digital paths,  allow or stop a process and in general provide timing for the circuit.  You can compare a clock with the traffic lights. They stop and allow the  traffic in a timely manner so that the traffic can flow smoothly with  the least delays.        If you just let the traffic through there will be a big jam and  the output is unpredictable.        </div><div align="left" style="margin-bottom: 12; margin-top: 12;">Clocks  are especially used for digital circuits with feedbacks and also to  avoid glitches in a circuit. What is a glitch? A glitch is an  unpredictable output. Say you have some input and for those you expect a  known output, but before the output settles to what you expect, you  might have one or more transitions that are not suppose to be there.  These are called glitches. They happen because the inputs have to go  through different gates and the propagation delay of each can be  different. Therefore the results arrive to the final gates in different  times. This difference in data arrival results in changes in the output  until all signals settle and the output is valid. If glitches are not  eliminated, they will go to the next stage of the circuit and generate  more unpredictable results. To avoid them a clock can be used to time  the signals. Assume the inputs to the circuit are provided with one  rising edge of the clock and the output of the circuit is read by the  next rising edge of the clock. If the period of the clock signal is  higher than the total propagation delay of the circuit, the output will  be read when it is completely settled and therefore no glitch happens.       </div><div align="left" style="margin-bottom: 12; margin-top: 12;">To store and pass the data or digital signals through,        some specific gates are used which are called <a href="http://www.designcabana.com/knowledge/electrical/electronics/digital/gates">latches or flip-flops</a>. These are some kind of memory that store their input over their output by a specific level or edge of the clock.        </div><div align="left" style="margin-bottom: 12; margin-top: 12;">A  clock with a higher speed will allow a faster process and that's why we  see the increase in the clock frequency in computers and processors  every day. But you may ask why won't we just increase it to the maximum  already? Well it is not that easy. As mentioned before clock has to wait  enough time for all the data to be ready and then pass them forward.  This means that the digital circuit delay becomes a very important  factor in all this. If the circuit delay is high, the clock has to be  slow to allow enough time for the data to arrive. Therefore increasing  the clock frequency is only possible if the circuit delay decreases and  that is a very hard thing to do in most cases.              </div><div align="left" style="margin-bottom: 12; margin-top: 12;"><strong>How to Generate        a Clock</strong>      </div><div align="left" style="margin-bottom: 12; margin-top: 12;">A clock generator is used to generate a clock, which         is an <a href="http://www.designcabana.com/knowledge/electrical/analog/oscilator">oscillator</a> that provides a square wave output. An oscillator circuit always has a  feedback that makes the circuit oscillate. This feedback also provides  parameters that can make a certain frequency. There are many different  ways to make an oscillator. Below you can see two of the famous ones.  First is to use a simple <a href="http://www.designcabana.com/knowledge/electrical/electronics/digital/gates">Inverter</a> plus a feedback component which usually is a crystal.       </div><div align="center" style="margin-bottom: 12; margin-top: 12;"><img height="88" src="http://www.designcabana.com/knowledge/electrical/electronics/digital/clock/osc1.gif" width="152" />             </div><div align="left" style="margin-bottom: 12; margin-top: 12;">Crystal  is an electrical component that is a very precise filter allowing only a  very specific frequency through. It usually looks something like below,  well it can come in any different size and form:             </div><div align="center" style="margin-bottom: 12; margin-top: 12;"><img height="120" src="http://www.designcabana.com/knowledge/electrical/electronics/digital/clock/crystal.jpg" width="180" />      </div><div align="left" style="margin-bottom: 12; margin-top: 12;">They  call it crystal because inside the package there is a piezoelectric       crystal with a very specific size and weight. A piezoelectric  crystal, when voltage is applied to it, can resonate with a very precise  frequency that depends on its size and properties and allows only  signals with its resonance frequency though. That's why it is used to  filter any other frequency and provide a fixes frequency signal. The  resonance frequency of the crystal is written on its package.        </div><div align="left" style="margin-bottom: 12; margin-top: 12;">In  the Circuit shown above, first assume the input of the inverter goes low  and therefore the output goes high. This transition which is usually  very sharp contains many different frequency harmonics, but only the one  with        the same frequency as the crystal passes through. So the high goes  to the inverter input and its output drops to low. This happens  continuously and therefore resulting in a square wave with a fixed  frequency.        </div><div align="left" style="margin-bottom: 12; margin-top: 12;">Below is another circuit using a Schmitt_Triggered inverter.             </div><div align="center" style="margin-bottom: 12; margin-top: 12;"><img height="130" src="http://www.designcabana.com/knowledge/electrical/electronics/digital/clock/osc2.gif" width="166" />             </div><div align="left" style="margin-bottom: 12; margin-top: 12;">A  Schmitt-Triggered inverter compares the input signal with two thresholds  instead of one as in simple inverters or gates, the input has to be  higher than one threshold for the output to change, and lower than the  other one for the output to change back. It generates       a hysteresis pattern which is showed in the figure below for the  inverter:        </div><div align="center" style="margin-bottom: 12; margin-top: 12;"><img height="150" src="http://www.designcabana.com/knowledge/electrical/electronics/digital/clock/hyst.gif" width="266" />             </div><div align="left" style="margin-bottom: 12; margin-top: 12;">Arrows  in the graph show the direction of the input voltage change. When there  is a low on the input of the inverter and a high at its output, the  capacitor on the input of the inverter is charged through the feedback  resistor. When the capacitor is charged high enough that the input  voltage of the inverter passes the higher threshold, then it's output  drops to zero. Now the capacitor starts discharging through the same  resistor and when its voltage drops below the lower threshold of the  inverter, its output jumps up again and this action keeps happening  resulting in the clock signal. Figure below shows the input and output  waveforms of the inverter.       </div><div align="center" style="margin-bottom: 12; margin-top: 12;"><img height="225" src="http://www.designcabana.com/knowledge/electrical/electronics/digital/clock/oscout.gif" width="290" />      </div><div align="left" style="margin-bottom: 12; margin-top: 12;">The  oscillating frequency        of this circuit depends on how fast the capacitor charges and  discharges, and therefore is a factor of the resistance and capacitance  values, while it is also dependent on the threshold levels.        </div><div align="left"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" style="height: 31px; width: 100%px;">            <tbody><tr>              <td height="31">Written by: <a href="http://designcabana.com/about/aboutme" target="_top">Mehdi                 Sadaghdar</a></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div>
