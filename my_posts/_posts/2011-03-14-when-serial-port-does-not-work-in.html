<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">I was trying to connect my powerpc board via serial port to my ubuntu machine but it was not working at all. I was not able to connect to my board via serial port instead of all correct serial port settings on minicom i.e 8N1 . I thought that the serial port of my ubuntu machine was having some problem as i tried to connect my board with other machine and it was working. After googling i found the exact problem which was stopping communication to happen<br /><br />So whenever working with serial port remember following steps in ubuntu<br /><br /><br /><ol><li> <i><b>Configure serial devices</b></i><br />/bin/setserial /dev/ttyS0 baud_base 115200 auto_irq skip_test autoconfig<br /></li><li><i><b>Enable RTS/CTS handshaking</b></i> <br />stty crtscts -F /dev/ttyS0</li></ol>&nbsp;It solved my problem. ;)</div>
