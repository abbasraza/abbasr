<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="text-align: -webkit-auto;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, 'Sans Serif';"></span></div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, 'Sans Serif';"><b>Cold &amp; Flu:</b></span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, 'Sans Serif';">All recent quitters need to be aware of two things thta can happen when getting cold or flu near the time that they quit smoking. First, a cold may be more annoying than normal. If anyone gets a cold within a few months of a quit, it is often a really uncomfortable one. The reason being not only are you producing excessive mucous from the infection itself, but since your Cilia are still in the process of cleaning out of the built up mucous that has been accumulated over the years and decades that never had a chance of coming out before, the amount of congestion and the symptoms can really make a person miserable.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, 'Sans Serif';">Also, with nerve cells that have now regenerated throughout your whole respiratory tract functioning normally, you can feel pain and irritation that were dulled when you were a smoker. It may have taken you a little longer as a smoker to even know when you were getting sick. With impaired nerve cells you may not have felt earlier symptoms, or if you did you may not have been able to differentiate what was just an effect of smoking too much or of actually having some sort of infection. With nerve cells back in place you are likely not going to be overly tempted to smoke for the concept of pouring hot irritating smoke on an already irritated throat is generally not a pleasant thought.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, 'Sans Serif';">Where you do have to be careful and aware is that when your cold starts to dissipate, you might get stronger than normal thoughts for cigarettes. For while you likely cut back on cigarette consumption when you were a smoker with a cold, when you started to get better you would have to make up for lost time, or more accurately, for lower than normal nicotine levels since you had instinctively cut cigarettes down to a bare minimum in those times. This makes the first time getting well a potentially powerful trigger. Just be aware of the fact and it will help you to minimize the effect. Then know that over your lifetime, your colds will probably be less frequent, resolve quicker and be less severe as long as you always remember to never take another puff!</span><br /><div><b style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, 'Sans Serif';"><br /></b><b style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, 'Sans Serif';">Weight Gain:</b><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, 'Sans Serif';">When a person stops smoking, he will start to eat more which results in weight gain. Nicotine directly affects the serotonin and dopamine activity so the appetite of the person decreases. Smoking increases metabolism and when you quit smoking the metabolism decreases. To avoid weight gain after you stop the smoking, avoid excess food and consume lots of water, fresh vegetables &amp; fruits.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, 'Sans Serif';"><i>I wish it comes out true :-)</i></span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, 'Sans Serif';"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, 'Sans Serif';"><b>Constipation:</b></span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, 'Sans Serif';">Person also experience constipation after quitting smoking. Nicotine relaxes the gut and keeps it regular so when you stop smoking you experience constipation. To overcome this problem, consume fibre rich foods and drink plenty of water &amp; fluids.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, 'Sans Serif';"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, 'Sans Serif';"></span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, 'Sans Serif';"><b>Anger:</b></span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, 'Sans Serif';">In the early days anger is very prevalent side effect. The toughest time when the person quit smoking is the initial 72 hours. Person feels difficult to control his temper and often feels frustrated which leads to digestive disorders and chest pain. Watch a movie, get a massage or go out on a trip to avoid this problem.</span><br /><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, 'Sans Serif';"><br /></span></div><br /></div></div>
