<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><br />All day I think about it, then at night I say it.<br />Where did I come from, and what am I supposed to be doing?<br />I have no idea. My soul is from elsewhere,<br />I am sure of that, and I intend to end up there.<br /><br />This drunkenness began in some other tavern.<br />When I get back around to that place, I'll be completely<br />sober. Meanwhile, I'm lke a bird from another continent,<br />sitting in this aviary. The day is coming when I fly off,<br />but who is it now in my ear who hears my voice?<br />Who says words with my mouth?<br /><br />Who looks out with my eyes? What is the soul?<br />I cannot stop asking. If I could taste one sip<br />of an answer, I could break out of this prison for drunks.<br />I didn't come here of my own accord,<br />and I can't leave that way.<br />Whoever brought me here will have to take me home.<br /><br />This poetry. I never know what I'm going to say.<br />I don't plan it. When I'm outside the saying of it,<br />I get very quiet and rarely speak at all.<br /><br />Shams Tabriz, if you would show your face<br />to me again, I could flee the imposition of this life.<br /><div><br /></div></div>
