This simple approach is perfectly acceptable      for most applications. When the primary consideration is an extra bright      display, the lowest possible power consumption, or a back light that can be      controlled over a very wide brightness range another method is needed. By using a <b><span style="color: #000099;">Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)</span></b>      scheme several advantages can be realized over the simple dc voltage method,      the main advantage is in efficiency in all schemes. <br />    <br />    <b><span style="color: #000099;">Maximum Backlight Brightness</span></b><br />    Let's consider a LED backlight module where the nominal LED driving current      for this display is 120ma which produces a typical brightness of 50 NIT. If,      instead of a dc or constant current, we apply 5 times the current, 600ma,      for 1/5 of the time, the average current is the same, 120ma. </span><br />     <div align="center">    <span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><img alt="PWM Duty Cycle" border="0" height="121" src="http://www.pacificdisplay.com/images/blfig9.gif" width="273" /></span></div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">    The average brightness of the LED would also be the same if measured      electronically. The difference is in the brightness perceived. The human eye      has a certain amount of persistence. If exposed to a bright light the eye      will "remember" the light for a short period of time. This allows us to view      a motion picture or TV screen as a steady image when in fact it is      flickering at 24 to 30 times a second. When the LED is flashed on brightly      for a short time and then turned off the eye "remembers" the light at the      high brightness level. The result is that the perceived brightness of the      back light is closer to the high pulsed brightness than to the lower average      dc brightness.<br />    <br />    This effect can be used to advantage in several ways. If the brightest      possible backlight is needed the display can be pulsed at a 1:4 on/off ratio      with 5 times the typical current. The pulse repetition frequency should be      greater than 100Hz so the flickering is<br />    not perceptible to the eye but not greater than about 1kHz.<br />    <br />    <span style="color: #000099;"><b>Lower Power for Normal </b></span>    <b><span style="color: #000099;">Backlight Brightness</span></b><br />    This technique can also be used to give a "normal" looking brightness level      to the display but at a Lower Average Current to save power. The average      power can be cut by a factor of at least 30% to produce a given perceived      brightness level. This can be a big advantage in battery operated equipment.     <br />    <br />    <b><span style="color: #000099;">Controlling Backlight Brightness</span></b><br />    One can also very the LED backlight brightness is by simply varying the DC      current to the LED's, but at low current the individual LED emitters start      to become visible resulting in an uneven looking back light. The third use      of the PWM method is to facilitate a wide range of brightness control for      the LED backlight, <u>without</u> an uneven looking back light. By varying      the on/off ratio of the controlling PWM waveform, a very wide range of      brightness can be achieved while maintaining a very even appearing back      light.</span><br /></div>
