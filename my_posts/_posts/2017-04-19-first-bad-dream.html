<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Last night i had a dream that someone is trying to kill me or stop me breathing by putting comforter over my face. I got up shouting and screaming (sounds like i was resisting the murderer efforts and trying to scare him with my shout). My mum, wife and daughter got scared, woke up and tried to calm me down. But it took me some time to hear their voices (before that i was shouting) and calm down.</div>
