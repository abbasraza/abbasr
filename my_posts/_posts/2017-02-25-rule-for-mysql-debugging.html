<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">1. Always use the client which is used by your application to access DB. Don't trust mysqlPro like clients when doing performance optimisations and measuring time taken by a query. for example I used libmysqlclient and wrote a small C program to find the difference in time taken by queries.<br /><br />2. Any application which is involved in accessing the DB should have optimised queries. Its very important. Use the right index, &nbsp;fetch necessary data, check JOINS etc</div>
