<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">&nbsp;"Do Not Populate" means exactly what it says - do not put a resistor there.<br /> <br />It is typical for design work to include extra components that are used only during<br />development. They are discarded in the final product.<br /><br /><b>for example:</b><br />Resistor R667 in below schematic is marked as DNP, meaning do not put a resistor here. So DAT3 is not actually pulled down by this resistor (as this resistor does not exist in final hardware and it was only there in hardware development process).<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-cpdlKJnRagQ/UTDly2obMoI/AAAAAAAAAQI/UYCTgL6R_yA/s1600/Screenshot-7.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="294" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-cpdlKJnRagQ/UTDly2obMoI/AAAAAAAAAQI/UYCTgL6R_yA/s640/Screenshot-7.png" width="640" /></a></div><br /></div>
