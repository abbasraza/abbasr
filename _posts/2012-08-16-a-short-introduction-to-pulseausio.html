This confuses the reader (why a sound server). okie what is a sound server ?<br />Let us see this with a practical example. You have Internet connection  and this Internet connection has to be shared among several PC’s what  you will do ?<br />What we do is make the PC as a network server and share the network  connection with other PCs. In the same way sound resource (a speaker  output) within a PC, is shared and controlled by different applications.<br />It is similar to a proxy network for sound systems.<br />Before getting into more detail we need to know about ALSA<br /><blockquote><strong> ALSA&nbsp; A</strong>dvance<strong> L</strong>inux<strong> S</strong>ound<strong> A</strong>rchitecture  is the expansion for ALSA. what ALSA does when requested to play a  audio. ALSA simply passes buffer (sound samples) through the sound card  (considering the sound card is registered for playback with ALSA), where  digital samples are converted to analog (simply DAC) by the sound card.</blockquote>When there is ALSA, why we need PulseAudio is a good question in your mind, read further.<br /><span id="more-425"></span>When a application requests ALSA to play a  audio (consider a song you like is played by xmms), the application  needs to know the sampling rate, channels use, sample size (16 bit or 24  bit) etc.,of the song to register with ALSA to play a song.<br />PulseAusio framework does all this for you. PulseAudio also has  features to change the sample format, channel counts, mixing several  sounds into one etc.,<br /><img alt="pulseaudio architecture" class="size-full wp-image-427 alignright" height="464" src="http://pauvam.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/pulseaudio_architecture.png" title="pulseaudio architecture" width="216" /><strong> </strong><br /><strong><br /></strong><strong>Let us take two real time scenario for example:</strong><br /><br />PulseAudio provides ..<br /><br /><strong>1) Sample Format conversion:</strong><br />Lets say a application wanted to play a audio file of 32K sampling  rate at a rate of 44K through the sound card. The application needs to  convert the source 32K bit samples file through sampling rate converter  to convert the audio to 44K. In this case the application would require a  additional component called sampling rate converter, this is provided  by PulseAudio framework.<br /><strong>2) Mixing</strong> <strong>audio </strong>(Audio1 + Audio2):<br />Lets view this from a mobile phone perspective. Consider you are  playing a song from your mobile, a short message interrupts the play.  The operating system pauses the song play, plays the tone to intimate  you a message has arrived and then continues playing the song.<br />If PulseAudio is available in the mobile, the song would be  continuing uninterruptedly. With the message notification mixed with the  song play.<br />Don’t worry, the OS will be designed to pause the sound play when you receive a call <img alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" src="http://pauvam.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" /> <br />One thing can strike your mind now, PulseAudio for Mobile? PulseAudio  is POSIX based so the sound server can be brought in a mobile also.<br />In Linux based systems, configuration for PulseAudio is available in.  (/etc/pulse). Some intro to config files before we wind up.<br /><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Grande', Verdana, Lucida, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; white-space: pre;"> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">/etc/pulse/daemon.conf</span>:  Configuration  settings  for the PulseAudio daemon.</span><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">/etc/pulse/default.pa</span>: The  default  configuration script to execute when the PulseAudio daemon is started.<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">/etc/pulse/client.conf</span>:  Configuration  settings for PulseAudio client applications.<br />All the config files can be placed in your home directory, to load  your personal settings, if personal config files are absent. The config  files in /etc/pulse is used.<br />I hope you should be interested with PulseAudio get started now from <a href="http://pulseaudio.org/wiki/TracGuide" target="_blank" title="PulseAudio Guide">here</a><br /><br />Summary: pulseaudio takes audio samples from applications and do format conversion/mixing audio sort of operations. Then ALSA passed sound samples through sound card and sound card converts digital samples to analog after that.<br /><br />Ref:<a href="http://pauvam.com/2010/04/18/pulseaudio-introduction-and-architecture/">http://pauvam.com/2010/04/18/pulseaudio-introduction-and-architecture/</a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
