<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;"><span class="Apple-style-span"> </span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;"><br />Microcontrollers differ from microprocessors in several ways. The main characteristic of microcontrollers is their wide variety of on-chip peripheral functions and memory that enable them to provide a single chip solution to many dedicated embedded designs.<br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small; font-weight: normal;">&nbsp;</span></div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small; font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">Microprocessors such as the Pentium inside a personal computer have only the Central Processing Unit and Math Co-processing unit. These microprocessors do not have built in memory, input or output functions such as parallel ports or serial ports etc. They are optimized to provide only the raw arithmetic and logic functions required by the operating system at the highest speed. All other components required to make the computer such as memory, input/output ports, serial, parallel, and mass storage are provided by external chips and devices. The Pentium is designed to meet a broad range of general computing needs that are provided with a personal computer.</span></span><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small; font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">&nbsp;</span></span><br /><br /><br /><br /><div align="center" class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;"><span class="Apple-style-span"><img height="355" src="http://www.tomchrane.com/Architecture/MicroprocessorBlock.jpg" width="443" /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;"><h2 class="MsoNormal style1" style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;"></h2></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;"><span class="Apple-style-span"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;"><span class="Apple-style-span">A microprocessor  such as the  Pentium inside a personal computer normally has a very  large instruction set.  In the case of the Pentium it is several hundred  instructions. The instructions  cover a very broad range of tasks and  functions. Some of these instructions can  be complex and take many  internal steps to execute within the processor. In  computer jargon we  categorize this type of instruction set as <b>CISC</b> or  Complex Instruction Set  Computer.&nbsp; CISC has its advantages in the  area  that it is used in such as high level languages and operating systems. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;"><span class="Apple-style-span"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;"><span class="Apple-style-span">One more  characteristic of  the microprocessor inside the personal computer is  the way it is attached to  and uses memory. The read/write memory inside  a pc is one very large block of  contiguous memory bytes. A typical PC  may have between 256 Megabytes and 2  Gigabytes of RAM memory. This  memory is used to store both programs and data.  The program that is  running must keep track of what areas are used for data and  what areas  are used for program instructions. A computer that uses the same  memory  space for both data and program instructions is classified as the <b>Von Neumann architecture</b>.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;"><span class="Apple-style-span"><br /></span></div><div align="center" class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;"><span class="Apple-style-span"><img height="275" src="http://www.tomchrane.com/Architecture/Architectures.jpg" width="400" /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;"><span class="Apple-style-span"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;"><span class="Apple-style-span">When we look at a  typical  microcontroller one of the first things we notice is that the  microcontroller  contains its own memory, parallel ports, clock and very  often a good number of  peripheral functions not found on a  microprocessor. In the case of PIC  microcontrollers we will find both  flash program memory where instructions are  stored and a separate ram  memory space where only data is stored. Computers  that have separate  memory spaces for data and program instructions are classified  as the <b>Harvard Architecture. </b>One   particular advantage of the Harvard Architecture is that data access  operations  can be taking place simultaneously with program instruction  execution. Each  memory area has its own data bus to the CPU so  operations can go on during the  same time frame.&nbsp; Many different   manufacturers use the Harvard Architecture for designs of  microcontrollers  because this design is very efficient for designing  specific purpose  controllers that go into other systems.  Microcontrollers usually get embedded  into other products such as  microwave ovens, automobile engine controllers,  power tools,  appliances, industrial instruments, hand held devices, cell phones  and  many other areas.&nbsp; The design and programming  for these types of  products and applications has become so specialized that it  has taken  on its own identity as “<b>embedded  design</b>”. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;"><span class="Apple-style-span"><br /></span></div><div align="center" class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;"><span class="Apple-style-span"><img height="355" src="http://www.tomchrane.com/Architecture/MicrocontrollerBlock.jpg" width="460" /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;"><span class="Apple-style-span"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;"><span class="Apple-style-span">The PIC  microcontroller also  has a very different type of instruction set. The  particular PIC  microcontroller located on the trainer board we will be  using is the  PIC16F877A. This is in the midrange family but its  capabilities are at the top  end of the midrange family. This unit only  uses 35 instructions! This is the  same for all microcontrollers in the  midrange family. The strategy that is used  in the design of this type  of microcontroller is to make a few very simple  instructions that  execute very fast. Using this strategy a complex task can be   accomplished with the combination of many very fast simple instructions  in a  relatively short time. Computers that use just a small number of  very simple  instructions that execute very fast are classified as <b>RISC</b>  or Reduced Instruction Set Computers. Since PIC  microcontrollers use  only 35 very simple instructions they fit neatly into this  category.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;"><span class="Apple-style-span"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;"><span class="Apple-style-span">The PIC 16F877A  has 8 K  words or program memory. Since each word in the midrange family  is 14 bits long  the program memory can also be expressed as 14 Kbytes.  The unit has 368 bytes of data  ram and 256 bytes of EEPROM. It has 8  channels of A/D with 10 bit resolution.  The unit has 2 8 bit  Timer/Counters and a single 16 bit Timer/Counter. In  addition to this  it has several different types of serial communication  functions such  as SPI, I2C, and normal pc type serial communications functions.  Up to  33 lines can be used for parallel input or output lines. It has a built   in clock circuit that can be used in a variety of configurations using   crystals, ceramic resonator, and RC timer circuitry. The availability  of these  resources makes the development of complete embedded systems  possible with very  few components in addition to the PIC  microcontroller.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;"><br /></div></div>
