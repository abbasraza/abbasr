<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Recently i used atheros wifi card which SDIO based device. To make it work on linux, i had to enable support in linux kernel as well as i had to place appropriate firmware in /lib/firmware directory in my rootfs. Why is that firmware needed? Isn't the driver which we have enabled in kernel enough ? Why don't we need firmware for other device like lets say USB?<br /><br />Answer: Some devices which <span style="background-color: lime;">do not have ROM </span>for storing the firmware, require us to load firmware into their RAM on run time. <span style="background-color: lime;">The hardware designed that way is cheaper and it makes easier for the vendor to fix firmware bugs.</span><br />So any device which has built-in ROM will contain its firmware inside it. While the devices which do not have ROM or very small ROM will require firmware to be loaded into RAM at run time for basic functionality OR advanced functionality .</div>
