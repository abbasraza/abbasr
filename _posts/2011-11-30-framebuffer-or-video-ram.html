<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">Video RAM (VRAM) means in general all forms of random access memory (<a href="http://searchmobilecomputing.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0,,sid40_gci214255,00.html">RAM</a>) used to store image data for a computer <a href="http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/0,,sid9_gci211965,00.html">display</a>.  All types of video RAM are special arrangements of dynamic RAM (DRAM).  Video RAM is really a <a href="http://searchcio-midmarket.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0,,sid183_gci211713,00.html">buffer</a> between the computer <a href="http://searchcio-midmarket.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0,,sid183_gci212833,00.html">processor</a> and the display and is often called the <i>frame buffer</i>.   When images are to be sent to the display, they are first read by the  processor as data from some form of main (non-video) RAM and then  written to video RAM.  From video RAM (the frame buffer), the data is  converted by a RAM digital-to-analog converter (RAMDAC) into <a href="http://searchcio-midmarket.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0,,sid183_gci211561,00.html">analog</a> signals that are sent to the display presentation mechanism such as a cathode ray tube (<a href="http://searchcio-midmarket.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0,,sid183_gci213839,00.html">CRT</a>).  Usually, video RAM comes in a 1 or 2 megabyte package and is located on the video adapter card in the computer.</span><br /><div id="articleBody"><div class="aside contentPoke"><div class="contentPokeContent"><h4><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">Learn More</span></h4><ul class="listTypeTooltip"><li><a href="http://searchstorage.techtarget.com/resources/Storage-Resources"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">Storage Resources</span></a></li></ul><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;"><span class="decorationTop"></span>    <span class="decorationBottom"></span>   </span></div></div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">  Most forms of video RAM are <i>dual-ported</i>, which means that  while the processor is writing a new image to video RAM, the display is  reading from video RAM to refresh its current display content.  The  dual-port design is the main difference between main RAM and video RAM.</span><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">Somewhat confusingly, the most common type of video RAM is called Video RAM (VRAM).Video RAM is the <a href="http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/0,,sid9_gci213272,00.html">vanilla</a>  flavor of video RAM.  It is dual-ported, allowing the processor to  write to it at the same time that it is refreshing the image on the  display monitor.  Other forms of video RAM include:</span><br /><ul><li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">Synchronous Graphics RAM (<a href="http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/0,,sid9_gci214202,00.html">SGRAM</a>) is clock-synchronized RAM that is used for video memory.  It is relatively low-cost video memory.  It uses <i>masked write</i>,  which enables selected data to be modified in a single operation rather  than as a sequence of read, update, and write operations.  It also uses  <i>block write</i>, which allows data for background or foreground  image fills to be handled more efficiently.  SGRAM is single-ported.   Its special features are what make it a moderately fast form of video  memory.  The Matrox Mystique is an example of a video card that uses  SGRAM.</span></li><li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">Window RAM (WRAM), unrelated to Microsoft Windows, is  very high-performance video RAM that is dual-ported and has about 25%  more bandwidth than VRAM but costs less.  It has features that make it  more efficient to read data for use in block fills and text drawing.  It  can be used for very high <a href="http://searchcio-midmarket.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0,,sid183_gci212895,00.html">resolution</a> (such as 1600 by 1200 pixels) using <a href="http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/0,,sid9_gci213224,00.html">true color</a>.  It's used in the Matrox Millenium video card.</span></li><li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">Multibank  Dynamic RAM (MDRAM) is a high-performance RAM, developed by MoSys, that  divides memory into multiple 32 kilobytes parts or "banks" that can be  accessed individually.  Traditional video RAM is monolithic; the entire  frame buffer is accessed at one time.  Having individual memory banks  allows accesses to be interleaved concurrently, increasing overall  performance.  It's also cheaper since, unlike other forms of video RAM,  cards can be manufactured with just the right amount of RAM for a given  resolution capability instead of requiring it to be in multiples of  megabytes. </span></li><li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">Rambus Dynamic RAM (DRAM) is a video RAM designed by Rambus that includes a proprietary <a href="http://searchstorage.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0,,sid5_gci211718,00.html">bus</a> that speeds up the data flow between video RAM and the frame buffer.  It's optimized for video streaming.</span></li></ul></div></div>
