<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Geany is a small and lightweight Integrated Development Environment. It was developed to provide a small and fast IDE, which has only a few dependencies from other packages. Once upon a time i was used to it... but i have forgot it completely at the moment.. so again i just installed it on my Ubuntu machine 'sudo apt-get install geany' and trying to explore its features.<br /><br />More info:<br /><span style="font-size: small;"><a href="http://www.geany.org/Main/About">About Geany</a></span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"><br /></span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;">&nbsp;</span> <br /><br /><br /></div>
