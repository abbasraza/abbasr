Resistive  technology works the way you might first imagine a touchscreen would  function – it senses pressure.</span><br /><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">The resistive touchscreen itself is made up of several layers, the  topmost of which flexes under your finger or stylus, and is pushed back  onto a layer behind it. This effectively completes a circuit, telling  the phone which part of the screen is being pressed.</span><br /><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;"><br /></span><br /><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">Capacitive touchscreens don’t rely on pressure, but rather they use  electrodes to sense the conductive properties of objects, such as your  finger. So, they don’t rely on having an object pressing particularly  hard on their surface, but will only react to certain objects. Prod one  with a standard stylus and you’ll get nowhere.</span><br /><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;"><br /></span><br /><span class="bodycontents" id="bodycontents"><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;"></span></span><br /><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;"><strong>In Practice</strong><br /><br />Thanks  to these core differences, the experience of using each type of  touchscreen is almost instantly recognisable. The most famous phone of  the last couple of years, Apple’s iPhone, uses a capacitive touchscreen,  which helps to give the phone its ‘light touch’ interface.</span><br /><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;"><br /></span><br /><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;"> As capacitive screens don’t need much contact at all, you can swipe  across them very lightly and get just as good a response as you would  with a slow, full-fingered drag. By comparison, the vast majority of  resistive touchscreen phones won’t normally react at all to a very light  swipe.<br /><br />More recent resistive touchscreen phones, such as the Nokia N97, HTC  Tattoo and Samsung Jet have made their resisitive touchscreens much more  sensitive than those of previous years, helping to bridge the gap  between the two technologies, but we’re yet to see a resistive  touchscreen that convinced us it was capacitive for any length of time.  Using a finger, capacitive screens will seem much more responsive.<br /><br />So, it may sound like a capacitive touchscreen is the way to go,  without any doubt, but things aren’t quite that simple – resistive  touchscreens have their benefits too.<br />The simplest is that they don’t rely on the organic properties of  your finger, so can be operated with just about anything – just not  necessarily successfully. A more important plus point of resistive  screens is that they offer more potential for accuracy.<br />If you try to operate a either sort of touchscreen phone with your  finger, accuracy will fly out of the window, but use a resistive phone  with a stylus and you’ll be able to get relative pinpoint accuracy.</span><br /></div>
