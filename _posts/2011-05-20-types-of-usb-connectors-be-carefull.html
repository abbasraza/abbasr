<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><br /><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">I got a problem.. USB OTG interface on my ARM board was not working in HOST mode. It even didnt show any kernel messages when i connected some USB device with OTG of my board. And what i found.... i was making a stupid mistake of using wrong USB connectors. Device side always needs a type B connector to be connected with it while HOST side needs a type A connector. </span><br /><br /><br /><div style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">Here is some details:</div><br /><div class="attr SUMMARY" style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;"><b><span class="size4">USB Ports and Connectors</span></b><br />There are two types of USB ports and connectors, Type A and Type B.<br /><br /><b>Type A</b><br />Type A ports and connectors are small and rectangular and are typically used to plug a device into a Type A USB port on a computer or a hub. Type A ports and connectors are sometimes referred to as "upstream".<br /><br /><img src="http://www0.info.apple.com/images/kbase/43004/43004_1.gif" /><br /><br /><b>Figure 1 </b>USB Type A port and connector  <br /><br /><b>Type B</b><br />Type B ports and connectors are small and square and are used to attach a USB cable to a <a class="ml-smartlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Serial_Bus">USB device</a>. Type B ports and connectors are sometimes referred to as "downstream".<br /><br /><br /><img src="http://www0.info.apple.com/images/kbase/43004/43004_2.gif" /><br /><br /><b>Figure 2 </b>USB Type B port and connector  <br /><br /><b>Note:</b> Many devices have a "captive," or attached, cable that includes a built-in USB connector.<br /><br /><br /><b>USB ports on the computer</b> <br />Your computer has two USB Type A ports; the top port is numbered 1 and the bottom port is numbered 2.<br /><br /><br /><h2 id="mini"><span style="font-size: small;">Mini USB A and B connectors</span></h2>The good thing of a <b>USB</b> connector standard is that it is possible to design devices without need to think how that device should be connected to other devices. The <b>USB A</b> and <b>B</b> connectors proofed their usability with devices like printers, modems and scanners, but when the faster <b>USB 2.0</b> was released and <b>USB</b> became not only a way to connect slow and bulky equipment but also faster and smaller devices like photo camera's and mobile telephones, especially the standard <b>USB B</b> connector was just too  big to fit nicely on these smaller equipment. An update to the <b>USB 2.0</b> specification was posted with the name <i>Mini-B connector engineering change notice</i> which defined a smaller version of the <b>B</b> connector. There has also existed a <b>mini USB A</b> connector for some time, but as the <b>USB A</b> connector is used on the power sourcing side—mostly a larger piece of equipment like a computer—that connector was withdrawn from the standard and no new devices will receive certification any more if they contain such a connector. In practice you won't find the <b>mini USB A</b> connector any more.            <br /><table><tbody><tr><td align="center" valign="top" width="50%"></td><td align="center" valign="top" width="50%"><br /></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div>
