<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><br />Your computer probably uses both static RAM and dynamic RAM at the  same time, but it uses them for different reasons because of the cost  difference between the two types. If you understand how dynamic RAM and  static RAM chips work inside, it is easy to see why the cost difference  is there,Â­ and you can also understand the names.<br />Dynamic RAM is the most common type of memory in use today. <span style="background-color: lime;">Inside a dynamic RAM chip, each memory cell holds one <a href="http://computer.howstuffworks.com/bytes.htm">bit</a> of information and is made up of two parts: a <a href="http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/transistor.htm">transistor</a> and a <a href="http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/capacitor.htm">capacitor</a>.</span> These are, of course, extremely small transistors and capacitors so  that millions of them can fit on a single memory chip. The capacitor  holds the bit of information -- a 0 or a 1 (see <a href="http://computer.howstuffworks.com/bytes.htm">How Bits and Bytes Work</a> for information on bits). The transistor acts as a switch that lets the  control circuitry on the memory chip read the capacitor or change its  state.<br /><span style="background-color: lime;">A capacitor is like a small bucket that is able to store  electrons. To store a 1 in the memory cell, the bucket is filled with  electrons. To store a 0, it is emptied. The problem with the capacitor's  bucket is that it has a leak. In a matter of a few milliseconds a full  bucket becomes empty. Therefore, for dynamic memory to work, either the  CPU or the <strong>memory controller</strong> has to come along and  recharge all of the capacitors holding a 1 before they discharge. To do  this, the memory controller reads the memory and then writes it right  back. This refresh operation happens automatically thousands of times  per second.</span><br /><span style="background-color: lime;">This refresh operation is where dynamic RAM gets its  name. Dynamic RAM has to be dynamically refreshed all of the time or it  forgets what it is holding. The downside of all of this refreshing is  that it takes time and slows down the memory.</span><br />Static RAM uses a completely different technology. <span style="background-color: lime;">In static RAM, a form of flip-flop holds each bit of memory (see <a href="http://computer.howstuffworks.com/boolean.htm">How Boolean Gates Work</a> for detail on flip-flops). A flip-flop for a memory cell takes 4 or 6  transistors along with some wiring, but never has to be refreshed.</span> This  makes static RAM significantly faster than dynamic RAM. However, because  it has more parts, a static memory cell takes a lot more space on a  chip than a dynamic memory cell. Therefore you get less memory per chip,  and that makes static RAM a lot more expensive.<br /><span style="background-color: lime;">So static RAM is  fast and expensive, and dynamic RAM is less expensive and slower.  Therefore static RAM is used to create the CPU's speed-sensitive <a href="http://computer.howstuffworks.com/cache.htm">cache</a>, while dynamic RAM forms the larger system RAM space.</span><br /><span style="background-color: lime;"><br /></span><span style="background-color: lime;"><br /></span><span style="background-color: lime;">Example: Static RAM used as OCRAM(on chip RAM) of i.MX6Q SOC. used for stack until uboot start execution from RAM?&nbsp;</span><br /></div>
