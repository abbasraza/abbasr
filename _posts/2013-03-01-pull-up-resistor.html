<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Let's say I have a microcontroller (MCU) with one pin configured as  an input. If I donâ€™t connect anything to the pin, it is considered  floating. This means the MCU might have a difficult time reading the  state or voltage on the input pin. A pull-up or pull-down resistor will  hold the pin to either a high or low state, while using a low amount of  current.<br />    <br />    Pull-ups are common on most input logic lines, two-wire (I2C) lines,  reset lines, et al. An application of a pull-up resistor is attaching a  button to an input pin.<br />   <div style="text-align: center;">    <img alt="" src="http://www.sparkfun.com/tutorial/PullupResistors/img1i.jpg" style="height: 266px; width: 363px;" /></div><br />    With a pull-up resistor, the input pin will read a high state when  the button is open. When the button closes, it connects the input pin  directly to ground, thus reading a low state. For this discussion we are  ignoring the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debounce#Contact_bounce" target="_blank">debounce</a> of the button.<br />        So what value resistor should you choose?<br />    <br />    The short and easy answer is that you want a resistor value on the order of 10kOhm for the pull-up.<br />   <ul><li>        A low resistor value is called a strong pull-up, a high resistor value is called a weak pull-up.</li></ul><br />   <div style="text-align: center;">    <img alt="" src="http://www.sparkfun.com/tutorial/PullupResistors/img2i.jpg" style="height: 272px; width: 381px;" /></div>The value of the pull-up resistor needs to be chosen to satisfy two conditions:<br />   <ol><li>        When the button is pressed, the input pin is pulled low. The  value of the resistor controls how much current you want to flow from  VCC through the resistor R1, through the button, and then to ground.</li><li>        When the button is not pressed, the input pin is pulled high.  The value of the pull-up resistor controls the voltage on the input pin.</li></ol>For condition 1, you don't want the resistor's value too low. The  lower the resistor, the more power will be used when the button is hit.  You generally want a large resistor value, but not too large as to  conflict with condition 2.<br />        The general rule for condition 2 is to use a pull-up resistor (R1)  that is an order of magnitude (1/10th) less than the input impedance  (R2) of the input pin. An input pin on a microcontroller has an  impedance that varies around 100k-1MOhm. For this discussion, impedance  is just a fancy way of saying resistance and is represented by R2 in the  picture above. So, when the button is not pressed, a very small amount  of current flows from VCC through R1 and into the input pin. The pull-up  resistor R1 and input pin impedance R2 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage_divider" target="_blank">divides</a> the voltage, and this voltage needs to be high enough for the input pin to read a high state.<br />    <br />    For example, if you use a 1MOhm resistor for the pull-up R1, and the  input pin's impedance R2 is on the order of 1MOhm, the voltage on the  input pin is going to be around half of VCC and the microcontroller  might not register the pin being in a high state. In other words, with  increasing values for R1, the voltage on the input pin decreases and you  don't want it too low.<br />        Keep in mind that many MCUs, like the ATmega328 on the Arduino, have internal pull-ups that can be enabled and disabled.<br />    <br />    Another thing to point out is that the larger the resistance for the  pull-up, the slower the pin is to respond to voltage changes. This is  because the system that feeds the input pin is essentially a capacitor  coupled with the pull-up resistor, thus forming a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RC_filter">RC filter</a>.  And RC filters take some time to charge and discharge. If you have a  really fast changing signal (like USB), a large pull-up can limit the  speed at which the pin can reliably change state.<br />    <br />    All of these factors play into the decision on what value pull-up resistor to use.<br />   <hr />  <h2>    <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"><strong>So Let's See an Example</strong><br />    </span></h2>Let's say you want to limit the current to exactly 1mA when the  button is pressed in the circuit above, where Vcc = 5V. What resistor  value should you use?<br />        It is easy to show how to calculate the pull-up resistor using Ohm's Law:<br />    <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"> </span><br />   <div style="text-align: center;">    <img alt="" src="http://www.sparkfun.com/tutorial/PullupResistors/eqn1i.jpg" style="height: 27px; width: 83px;" /></div>Referring to the pictures above, Ohm's Law now is:<br />   <div style="text-align: center;">    <img alt="" src="http://www.sparkfun.com/tutorial/PullupResistors/eqn5.jpg" style="height: 26px; width: 271px;" /></div><br />    Rearrange the above equation with some simple algebra to solve for the resistor<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">:<br />    </span><br />   <div style="text-align: center;">    <img alt="" src="http://www.sparkfun.com/tutorial/PullupResistors/eqn3i.jpg" style="height: 71px; width: 422px;" /></div>Remember to convert all of your units into Volts, Amps and Ohms  before calculating (e.g. 1mA = 0.001 Amps). The solution is to use a <strong>5K Ohm restistor</strong>.<br /></div>
