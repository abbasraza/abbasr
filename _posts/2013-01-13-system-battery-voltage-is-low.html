If you pull the battery and then let the board discharge (up to an hour, depending on the board) the date will default to the earliest time in the BIOS version, The Bios will loose its custom settings and any BIOS password will be deleted.<br /><b>3)<br />Keeps the System Date and Time</b>The CMOS battery stores the system time and settings that most be loaded when you turn the system on. Older computers reset to a date of 1-1-1980. Computers running Windows XP or later will set the system date to the date of the last saved system restore point.<br /><b>Allows System Settings to be called up</b>A few additional settings are stored by the system. The CMOS battery allows these settings to be loaded into system memory when the computer boots.<br /><b>Why does it look like a watch battery?</b>The CMOS battery is a standard-size watch battery in most desktop systems. The user can buy a replacement at any place that sells watches.<br /><b>How long does this battery last?</b>CMOS batteries can last for 5 years. If a computer's CMOS battery loses a charge, you will have to manually set the system date and time.<br /><b>What does CMOS stand for?</b>CMOS is the acronym for Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="background-color: white;"><span style="background-color: white; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: -webkit-auto;"></span></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #333333; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"></div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div></div>
