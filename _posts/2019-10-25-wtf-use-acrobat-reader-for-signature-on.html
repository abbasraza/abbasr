<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Used preview a lot for pdfs on osx. but the problem is , it doesn't remember the signatures .<br />due to which every time i need to sign a document,&nbsp; i have to start from zero again and place a page with signature on it infront of my macbook so that preview can capture my signatures. And once you quit preview, it forgets about the signature and next time you will have to do it again.<br /><br />Better use Acrobat reader, it can upload signature by image as well. So easy.</div>
